(b) Produve interpretation of each coefficient

- Urban does not have small p value, hence it does not seem to have any effect on Sales.
- The rest, pPrice and US seem to have an effect
- For Price, having coefficient of -0.05 means that for every 100 dollars more in price of a carseat decreases the sales
  by 5000 dollars.
  - For US[yes], the coeficient is 1.2, meaning that simply that, for stores in the US, there are 1200 more dollars in
    Sales compared to similar stores in other countries.

(c) 13.04 + (-0.05) (Price) + (1.2) (US[yes]) + (-0.02) (Urban[yes]) = Sales
