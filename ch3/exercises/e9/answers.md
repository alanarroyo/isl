9(i) Yes. F-statistic is considerable larger than 1, which implies there is a relationship between the predictors and
the response.
9(ii) Weight, year, and origin (and potentially displacement) have statistically significant response. 
9(iii) The newer the car, the more efficient it is (mpg increases).

9(d) There is a unusually large outlier but no high leverage points.
