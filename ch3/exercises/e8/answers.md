Is there a relationship between the predictor and the response?
Yes, p value is very very small, which shows that the null hypothesis of the horsepower not having any effect on mpg is probably not correct.

How strong is the relationship between the predictor and the response?

mpg ranges from 9 to 46
while horsepower ranges from 46 to 230

as the coefficient of horsepower is -0.1578, this means that, according to the model, with the increas of 10 units of
horsepower, this translates into the decrease of aprox 1.5 mpg (one mile less my friend). To me that sounds like
slightly strong relationship between the prediction and the response.

Is the relationship between the predictor and the response positive or negative?
Negative.

What is the predicted mpg associated with horsepower of 98?. What are the associated 95% confidence and prediction
intervals?
